This archive contains meshes of all of the regular and semi-regular tilings of
the plane.  Here a "regular" tiling is one consisting of only a single regular
polygon with unit length edges.  A "semi-regular" tiling may contain more than
one type of polygon, but each vertex will look identical (up to rotation).

The archive includes:

1. meshes of the three regular tilings (square.obj, triangle.obj, hexagon.obj)
2. meshes of the eight semi-regular tilings (semi1.obj through semi8.obj)
3. the C++ source used to generate these meshes (tiling.cpp)

The source can be used to generate larger meshes (i.e., ones with more faces),
though the meshes generated by this program will contain unused vertices.  The
meshes included in this archive are cleaned-up versions of the program's output.
Instructions on how to use the program can be found in its source file or by
running the executable with the argument "-help".
